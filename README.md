# Netflix and Chill v1.2

**NOTE**
v1.2 is still being written and committed, as soon as it is production ready, there will be a release posted in the "Releases" section of this repository.

This is the Github repository for Netflix and Chill, a python-based program that you can use to surf a basic SQL database for what movie you wanna watch tonight! Written with love by u/thatswhereurwrongkiddo.

Please do NOT edit any files or directories unless you know what you're doing, it could easily make the program unusable and cause you to just have a bad time.

This program is licensed under the MIT License, so if you do know what you're doing, feel completely free to mess around with whatever you want to. After all, the files are yours after you download them, just please, for the love of god, if you republish it, just credit me, that's all I ask. Not too hard, right?

Have fun, and enjoy movie night!
